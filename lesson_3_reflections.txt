When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There may be times when i am not connected to internet, may be i am on the go or holidaying in amazon forest(Might not be the best place to go for holiday though), in these situations if i want to work and i have a local repository i can continue working on it and when i will come back from amazon forest i will commit my changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes i may be working on some new cool feature(obviously) and in this case if Git pull changes automatically it may brake my changes and i don't want to sit everytime to resolve those issues. I will finish my changes and then i will do push pull, having command in your hand has it's own advantages ;) .

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Forks are similar to clone but on github, using fork we can clone a repo
on github and work on it as a seperate repo.
-Clones are cloning a repo from github to local or in local from one
place to another. cloning simply means copying.
-Branches are basically ways to divide our code in two seperate directions so that we can work on each one of them individually and don't have to clone it or fork it
into a seperate repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-Having local copy of remote state will help us in checking if there are any conflicts we have with the remove state when we are not online. Although we can't check any new changes in remote since we are offline we can atleast be in synch with the last known state of remote.
